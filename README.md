# Euler-Project

Euler Project (https://projecteuler.net/) assembles various problems demanding mathematical and programming insights. This repository contains the solutions (not in absolute sense) to the problems.


# Disclaimer

Do not deprive yourself of the pleasure of solving problems first by your own. Despite the fact that publishing solutions outside of Euler Project is discouraged, there were no explicit prohibitions on such an action, so by looking at the answers, you accept all responsibility. Once again, first solving by oneself, than checking to be sure is a welcomed way-to-do.
